# Skin_Disease_Detection
The healthcare sector today faces the impossible challenge of early disease detection. Timely
identification of critical diseases such as Diabetes, Pneumonia, Brain Tumors, and Breast Cancer is
essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, the existing healthcare
infrastructure often falls short of providing accessible and cost-effective solutions for early disease
detection. The "HealthCure" project addresses this challenge by using various AI machine and
deep learning technologies. The primary problem that our project seeks to solve includes:

Key Issues:
● Difficult to identify diseases: The patient can’t get accurate information related to their
disease.
● Limited Accessibility: Existing diagnostic methods are often confined to specialized
medical facilities, limiting access for individuals in remote or underserved areas.
● High Costs: Traditional diagnostic procedures can be expensive, creating a financial
barrier to early disease detection for many individuals.
● Time-Consuming Diagnosis: The diagnostic process can be time-consuming, delaying
timely treatment and potentially exacerbating the condition
● Accuracy: Human error is inherent in manual diagnosis, leading to potential misdiagnosis
or delayed treatment initiation
● Detection of Multiple Diseases: Different diseases require distinct diagnostic approaches.
An integrated solution for the detection of multiple diseases is often lacking.
